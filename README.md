SJSU &lt;> ASTRO-101 &lt;> Stellar Evolution Simulator

As a final project for SJSU's ASTRO-101 course, I've created a project in blender in which I've developed a simple script in python that creates a star in space. The user is given the ability to play with the star's properties (radius and temperature) to visually learn about the Stefan-Botlzmann Law, in relation to stellar evolution. Through this simulation, I hope users can gain a useful perspective on the relationships between the radius, temperature, and luminosity of stars across the universe.
